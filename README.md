This is a project I created for Data Programming at App State. It performs a DFS search of the website Bitchute,
which is a website known for hosting hateful, extremist content, and stores the comments of all the videos it finds.
The website appears to be written in a dynamic Javascript framework, so I had to experiment to get data in a useable format.
*I also would not recommend looking too closely at the data being scraped if you have any sensitivities at all that may
be offended.*
